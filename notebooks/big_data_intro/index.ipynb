    "## Introduction\n",
    "Have you ever wondered how much data (in the form of texts, phone calls, videos, emails, searches, etc.) do we generate only when using our smartphones? Approximately 40 exabytes (40 million terabytes) of data gets generated every month by a single smartphone user! Now have fun multiplying it by 5 billion (and counting) users :)\n",
    "<br /><br />\n",
    "Traditional computing systems are no longer capable of handling this amount of data which we call Big Data.\n",
    "In the following sections we learn what data should we call Big Data, learn about some applications, and get familiar with some tools and techniques which are utilized to store and process that data.\n",
    "<br /><br />\n",
    "In the end, some extra links are provided for [further studying](#Further-Reading) the subjects discussed.\n",

    "## Definition\n",
    "A piece of data is classified as Big Data regarding to the concept of a bunch of **V**s. In order to understand them, consider health care industry and medical records as an example:\n",
    "  - **Volume**: Hospitals and clinics collect massive volume of data (more than 2000 exabytes) every year.\n",
    "  - **Velocity**: This data is generated at a very high speed.\n",
    "  - **Variety**: Various data types are collected such as structured (e.g. excel records), semi-structured (e.g. log files) and unstructured data (e.g. X-ray images), which complicates detecting and categorizing important and related data to our goal (which can be fast disease detection or better treatment).\n",
    "  - and other characteristics such as **Value**, **Veracity** and **Variability** which you can learn more about [here](https://www.motivaction.nl/en/news/blog/big-data-the-6-vs-you-need-to-look-at-for-important-insights).\n",

    "## Architecture\n",
    "Various frameworks are developed to ease the processing and storage of Big Data such as Cassandra, Apache Hadoop, and Apache Spark. But first, let's talk about a rather new parallel processing model designed to deal with some of Big Data challenges called **MapReduce**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### MapReduce\n",
    "MapReduce is a software framework and programming model used for processing huge amounts of data which comprises two phases, **Map** and **Reduce**. Map tasks deal with splitting and mapping of data while Reduce tasks shuffle and reduce the data. The following image pretty much sums up the MapReduce architecture in _Hadoop_.\n",
